                                    <p><b>At the end of the Summer Science and Engineering Program, I done some research on this topic. I learned that smoking affects both male and female fertility. Women have always been told that they need to quit smoking in order to have a healthy child or to carry their baby to full term but they never mentioned anything about males smoking and their fertility. Smoking causes male's sperm count to go decrease making it hard to fertilize an egg. However, this does not apply to everyone. Moral of the story is to simply stop smoking to live a healthier life for you and/or your family.

                                <p>Since I was in the 5th grade, I have always known that I’ve wanted to become a doctor. I was never sure of what kind of doctor but I figured that I would get it together before I graduated from High School. My grandfather is a family physician in Jackson, MS. Whenever I go to his office, my insides tingle. I feel as if I want to call the patients to the back and stand in the room to help treat the patient. That was my starting experience to my future. My sophomore year in high school my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was faced with taking care of her while my mother went to work or when I came home from school I would offer to help so that she may have a break. After many chemotherapy appointments, there weren’t any more cancer cells. I felt accomplished. I gave being an oncologist a thought. A few months later, the cancer was back; this time being more aggressive and metastasizing to her brain. Her body began to decline the chemo so there was only a matter of time before the end approached. I started to blame myself for failing her and not helping her get better. I tried everything that I knew but she wasn't getting any better. On August 22 of 2014, my grandmother died of respiratory failure due to the cancer. I had failed. Becoming an oncologist wouldn't be very beneficial. Something has to give. This tragic event opened my eyes to do the next biggest thing. I enjoy watching any show dealing with emergency rooms and performing surgery. Well, why not become an Emergency Physician. I guess you can say that my grandfather and my grandmother both inspired me to become an Emergency Room Physician. To me family is very important and I am very thankful to have a loving and caring but sometimes they can really get annoying. My family is quite dysfunctional but isn't that all families? I wouldn’t trade them for anything in the world. We may say things that we don't mean and argue but there will always be that unconditional love present. Life would be different if I didn't have the family that I have now. I am taught that no matter what difficulties I have to face, my family would always be there and support me. They teach me many things about life that I would take with me for the rest of my life. No matter how many good friends you have, they will never be there for you forever, but family will always be there for you. Not everyone has a perfect family; therefore, I must appreciate what I have now because not everyone is as lucky as me to have a family that cares for each other through out all the different circumstances. </p>
